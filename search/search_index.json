This system is an ideal alternative to traditional PLC + HMI combinations, significantly reducing costs and simplifying installation.The device integrates a touchscreen display that enables visualization and parameter configuration directly on the device. With support for CAN, RS485, Ethernet, and WiFi communication interfaces, it is ready for integration into a wide range of industrial applications. Although the device does not include built-in digital or analog inputs and outputs, it offers high flexibility through external I/O expansion cards, which can be connected similarly to conventional PLC systems. This ensures maximum modularity without compromise.</p>"},{"location":"hardware/overview/#support-open-source-graphics-library-lvgl","title":"Support open-source Graphics Library-LVGL","text":"<p>LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is a powerful graphics library that enables the creation of advanced visual interfaces on various hardware platforms.
