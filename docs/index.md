fabrika-platform is a next-generation technology platform designed for the development, production and integration of compact control systems and HMI interfaces. It combines professionally designed custom-made hardware with a flexible software ecosystem that is partially open-source and open to expansion. The platform is built to simplify the development of single-purpose devices, automation solutions and smart installations - from industry to home.
## Key features:

    new generation microcontrollers with hardware acceleration for graphics and communication
    touch HMI panels meeting industry standards
    modular architecture - the ability to connect expansion cards, sensors, power modules and custom applications
    support for RS485, CAN, Ethernet and other industrial interfaces and protocols
    open software foundation: freely available libraries and tools (LVGL, MQTT, REST API, Modbus, WebUI...)
    optimized closed libraries and technology modules for robustness and support for professional deployments
    strong focus on quality, stability and documentation

## Why fabrika-platform?

Most existing HMI and PLC solutions are too closed or uncustomizable. fabrika-platform creates a bridge between the industry standard and the open-source world - allowing developers, installers and companies to create their own solutions quickly, cost-effectively and without the need for licensing restrictions.

## License and Accessibility

Hardware modules are designed and manufactured locally. Selected parts of the software are available under open licenses, while some libraries are closed to support and protect critical functionality. The goal is to balance development freedom with the quality of deployment reliability.
